# Go HTTP transports & middlewares for outgoing HTTP requests

Chaining transports is a pattern originally inspired by this article https://dev.to/stevenacoffman/tripperwares-http-client-middleware-chaining-roundtrippers-3o00.
This pattern is similar to middleware pattern which is used to enrich a context of http request coming to your application.
There are multiple use-cases where this pattern comes handy such as request logging, caching, authentication and even implementation of retry mechanisms.


## Examples

Set up HTTP client, which sets `User-Agent`, `Authorization` and `TraceID` headers automatically :
```go
authClient := http.Client{
    Transport: transport.Chain(
        http.DefaultTransport,
        transport.SetHeader("User-Agent", userAgent),
        transport.SetHeader("Authorization", authHeader),
        transport.TraceID,
    ),
    Timeout: 15 * time.Second,
}
```

Or debug all outgoing requests globally within your application:
```go
if debugMode {
    http.DefaultTransport = transport.Chain(
        http.DefaultTransport,
        transport.LogRequests,
    )
}
```
