singleflight
============

copied from https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/blob/main/util/singleflight/singleflight.go which
is originally derived from golang.org/x/sync.

In the future, would be nice for this package to support "context" as well,
see https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/issues/6981
